    "## 1. Understanding BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 BERT Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is based on the Transformer architecture, specifically the encoder part of the Transformer. Unlike traditional models that read text input sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left), BERT reads the entire sequence of words at once, enabling bidirectional understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transformer Encoder Layers:** Stack of encoder layers, each consisting of Multi-Head Self-Attention and Feedforward Neural Networks.\n",
    "- **Input Representation:** Combines token embeddings, segment embeddings, and positional embeddings.\n",
    "- **Pre-training Tasks:** Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagram:**\n",
    "\n",
    "![BERT Architecture](https://humboldt-wi.github.io/blog/img/seminar/bert/bert_architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figure: BERT Architecture*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Masked Language Modeling (MLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Predict masked tokens in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly mask some tokens in the input sequence.\n",
    "2. The model attempts to predict the original value of the masked tokens based on their context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Original Sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.```\n",
    "\n",
    "Masked Sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```The quick [MASK] fox jumps over the lazy dog.```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 15% of tokens are selected for masking.\n",
    "- Of the selected tokens:\n",
    "  - 80% are replaced with `[MASK]`.\n",
    "  - 10% are replaced with a random token.\n",
    "  - 10% remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Understand the relationship between two sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- During pre-training, the model is given pairs of sentences.\n",
    "- It predicts whether the second sentence is the actual next sentence in the original text or a random sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence A:\n",
    "\n",
    "```The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence A:\n",
    "\n",
    "```A fast, dark-colored fox leaps above a sleepy canine.```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is Sentence B the next sentence after Sentence A?*  \n",
    "**Label:** Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 50% of the pairs are actual consecutive sentences.\n",
    "- 50% are random sentence pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Bidirectional Contextualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike unidirectional models that process text in one direction, BERT’s bidirectional approach allows it to consider both left and right context simultaneously. This leads to a deeper understanding of language nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contextual Understanding:** Better grasp of word meanings based on surrounding text.\n",
    "- **Handling Polysemy:** Ability to disambiguate words with multiple meanings.\n",
    "- **Enhanced Representations:** More informative embeddings for downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Exploring BERT Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT has inspired numerous variants aimed at improving efficiency, scalability, and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Enhancements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Data:** Uses more data and longer training times.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Masking:** Masks tokens dynamically during training instead of statically.\n",
    "- **No NSP Task:** Removes the Next Sentence Prediction task, focusing solely on MLM.\n",
    "- **Larger Batch Sizes:** Utilizes larger mini-batches for more stable training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improved performance on various benchmarks compared to the original BERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 DistilBERT\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Enhancements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Compression:** Reduces the size of BERT by 40% while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities.\n",
    "- **Knowledge Distillation:** Trains a smaller model (student) to mimic the behavior of a larger model (teacher).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Faster inference times.\n",
    "- Reduced computational resources required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 ALBERT (A Lite BERT)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Enhancements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter Sharing:** Shares parameters across layers to reduce model size.\n",
    "- **Factorized Embedding Parameterization:** Separates the size of hidden layers from the size of embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Significantly fewer parameters.\n",
    "- Comparable or better performance with reduced memory footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 GPT Series (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** While GPT models are more focused on generative tasks and utilize the decoder part of the Transformer, they share foundational similarities with BERT in leveraging Transformer architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unidirectional Contextualization:** Processes text in a left-to-right manner.\n",
    "- **Generative Capabilities:** Excels at generating coherent and contextually relevant text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Implementing BERT with HuggingFace Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "HuggingFace's `transformers` library provides a user-friendly interface to leverage pre-trained BERT models for various NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First, ensure that the necessary libraries are installed."

      "Sentence: This is a case of taking a fairy tale too far. The Enchanted Cottage delivers Dorothy McGuire as a \"terrible ugly\" spinster and Robert Young as a disfigured pilot. Long story short: Scarface marries Spinster, after which their love transforms them, miraculously (lighting, cosmetics and the removal of fake scars), into beautiful peoplea magical change that they attribute to the enchantment of living in a seaside cottage that has been the abode of generations of honeymooners.<br /><br />If the story stopped there, fine; it would be a fable with a proverbial message: beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But it lurches ahead, reaching for reality. When Mr. and Mrs. Scarface greet their public, it comes as a painful shock to them that they're still homely. You see, they only appear beautiful to each other a situation which the audience is well prepared for because all the secondary characters have been sermonizing that ill-favored people really need to lower their expectations, and find other ways to be happy. You know. Take up hobbies. Spinster does woodcuts, for instance. Scarface considers collecting driftwood.<br /><br />The original playwright (Arthur Wing Pinero) and the filmmakers have zero faith in human nature. Their message is: You're either ugly or pretty, and no pretty person would ever love an ugly one. What's even worse, ugly people evidently need to imagine their lover as pretty. Reality just won't do.<br /><br />One wonders what Elaine Mason saw every day when she looked at her husband, Stephen Hawking.\n",

      "Sentence: This is the very La Nouvelle Vague.One of the best films of the New Wave and I dare say one of the first ten ever made! Why? The atmosphere, the story,the actors (actress) are all brilliant. This is the theater, a fairy tale, the life, the film.Paris. Thank you Mr.Rivette.\n",

      "Sentence: I've liked Milos Forman's movies since I saw \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"Amadeus\" (two big masterpieces), but when I saw \"Hair\", I kept wondering if this was the same Milos Forman. This movie is boring and uninteresting to say the least. OK, the music is pretty good, but on screen it only seems like a bunch of drugged people dancing around (wait a minute... that's what it really is!). In fact, the only interesting part, and the only part where Milos' talent shows up, are the last 15 minutes or so, (SPOILER!!) since when Berger takes Claude's place as a soldier set to the Vietnam war. That 15 minutes are moving and well-directed, but it's a shame that we have to endure so much awful material before that.<br /><br />Well, maybe this is one of those movies you need to be \"on the subject\" to enjoy (the subject being marijuana, acid and other drugs the film glorifies). I'm not, so...\n",

      "Sentence: Okay, last night, August 18th, 2004, I had the distinct displeasure of meeting Mr. Van Bebble at a showing of the film The Manson Family at the Three Penny in Chicago as part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Here's what I have to say about it. First of all, the film is an obvious rip off of every Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam movie I've ever seen. Second of all, in a short Q & A session after the show Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual Manson Family members or Charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them, that the film was based on his (Van Bebble's) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on TV and in the news (and I'm assuming from the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative). So I had second dibs on questions, I asked if he was trying to present the outsider, Mtv, sex drugs and rock 'n roll version and not necessarily the true story. This question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting \"f*** you, shut the f*** up, this is the truth! All those other movies are bullsh**!\"<br /><br />Well anyway, I didn't even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when I read the tagline for the film, \"You've heard the laws side of the story...now hear the story as it is told by the Manson Family.\" Excuse me, if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn't want to have anything to do with, how in God's name can he tell the story for them!? This is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard! The film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock 'n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small, dimly lit theatre, and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock 'n roll mind of a man who couldn't even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of Rocky Horroresque call line to the actors on screen. This film accomplishes little more than warping the public's image of actual events (which helped shape the state of America and much of the world today) into some sort of Slasher/Comic Book/Porno/Rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual.<br /><br />The film was definitely very impressive to look at. The soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of Charlie's work with the Family off of his Lie album. The editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos. All in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at Mtv than to the Underground Film Festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers. I felt like I was at a midnight Rocky Horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was very good with the exception of Charlie who resembled some sort of stoned Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying. The descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy, throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow, lethargic, and chubby representation that was actually presented.<br /><br />All in all the film basically explains itself as Sadie (or maybe it was Linda) declares at the end, \"You can write a bunch of bullsh** books or make a bunch of bullsh** movies...etc. etc.\" Case in point. Even the disclaimer \"Based on a True Story\" is a dead giveaway, signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world. All you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap, or actually, maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead.<br /><br />All I can say is this, when the film ended I got a free beer so I'm glad I went, but not so glad I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f*** up for asking the director a question. Peace.\n",

      "Sentence: There was a time when the Alien series was a success with even the third installment, Alien 3, showing promise under the guild of a fresh and young David Fincher. The first Predator was a box office hit mainly due to its story, \"in peak\" star Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan (Die Hard). The films Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator were all highly successful and created massive followings among general film fans and science fiction fans alike. Arguably Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should have signaled the end for both franchises, but studios were undeterred and saw the opportunity to pander to the rumours among fans and combine the two. Step in Paul W.S Anderson, Alien Vs Predator, and now the Brothers Strauss (visual effects graduates, not even directors or writers). The problem was that by allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the Sci-Fi genre to fall into the hands of firstly a mediocre director and now directorial newbie's has led to nothing more than profanity, epitomised by incompetence. Upon witnessing Alien Vs Predator Requiem (AVPR) die-hard fans will feel sick to their stomachs that this series could have got any worse.<br /><br />One example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among fans. The film begins with an Alien making its way onto the Predator ship, spurting from the predators chest, growing in to a full grown Predalien and bringing down the Predator craft (which now seems to have far less Predators on it than it did at the end of Alien Vs Predator) and all this occurs with the ship still in Earths atmosphere. Once the ship has crashed AVPR quickly resorts to cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions, it makes no venture at utilizing any of the twists or subversions served up in the two original films. The wearisome plot progresses with tedious pace, punctuated only by the near rousing conflicts of Alien and Predator and when that runs the risk of boring us we are treated to either an alluring blonde in a bikini or rapid gunfire. AVPR is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative elucidation i.e. members of the public outwitting an elite military unit or the Predator not adhering to laws established in previous editions. This is a film that has a complete disregard for its predecessors, it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and in doing so one gets the feeling that it is trying to set itself up as a stand alone feature. Independently the film has no heart, no conviction and no soul and with reference to the other films lacks even the most basic continuity. This is exemplified by the over arching narrative of the film as it undermines the basic premise of the first Alien. Because if the species had been encountered before then those in the first Alien film would have been more proficient and not so ill prepared when encountering them.<br /><br />On a cinematic note the film is close to being dire, I felt urged at some points to shine a torch at the screen, the lighting was so bad. Through utilizing such gloomy and dark effects the audience may feel as though they are being cheated out of some the action  which is ironically its purpose and also indicates the films lack of budget. As with all science fiction one scene normally surfaces as being the most memorable, in this instance it is probably the hospital impregnation scene as it ever so tenuously draws on the themes of the original Alien by literalizing it. The directing is poor, performances weak and the script rotten. AVPR is the product of a conveyor belt system of film-making in which ideas and techniques are assembled by ineffective people and then the finished product distributed among cinemas. This is personified by the absence of gory death scenes and drawn out blood battles because the certification will not allow it  a lower certification achieving a larger target audience. AVPR was purely a business venture and nothing more.\n",
