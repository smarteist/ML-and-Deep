    "# The Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture introduced in the paper *\"Attention is All You Need\"* (Vaswani et al., 2017) revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by relying solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. This design allows for more parallelization and better handling of long-range dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explain the core components of the Transformer:**\n",
    "   - Multi-Head Self-Attention\n",
    "   - Positional Encoding\n",
    "   - Feedforward Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Show a simplified implementation in PyTorch.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Familiarity with PyTorch tensors and modules.\n",
    "- Basic understanding of attention mechanisms from previous studies.\n",
    "- Knowledge of linear transformations and embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Transformer: A High-Level Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A Transformer consists of a stack of identical layers in both the **encoder** and **decoder**. Each encoder layer primarily includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Head Self-Attention:**  \n",
    "   Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence, computing attention multiple times in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feedforward Layers:**  \n",
    "   A fully connected network applied to each position, expanding the representational capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add & Norm Steps:**  \n",
    "   Residual connections and layer normalization are applied after the attention and feedforward sub-layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder has a similar structure but includes a second attention layer for attending to the encoder outputs and uses masking to ensure the decoder only attends to previous tokens when training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Innovation:**  \n",
    "The Transformer does not rely on recurrence or convolutions. Instead, it uses **attention** to directly relate every token in the input sequence to every other token. This allows parallel processing and better handles long-range dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Multi-Head Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Self-Attention Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-attention takes a sequence of embeddings (the input tokens embedded into vector space) and transforms them into a new sequence of the same length. For each position, it computes a weighted combination of all other positions, determining how much each other token influences this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( Q \\) (Query): Transformed representation of the token we’re focusing on.\n",
    "- \\( K \\) (Key): Transformed representation of the context tokens.\n",
    "- \\( V \\) (Value): Transformed representation used to produce the final output.\n",
    "- \\( d_k \\): Dimensionality of the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of computing just one attention function, the Transformer uses **multiple heads**. Each head projects the queries, keys, and values into a different subspace and performs attention in parallel. The results are concatenated and projected again, allowing the model to focus on different types of relationships simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula for Multi-Head:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Concat}(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each head \\( head_i = \\text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different attention heads can capture different relations or types of information.\n",
    "- More expressive power than a single-head attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Positional Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer has no inherent notion of sequence order since it does not use recurrence or convolution. To represent the position of each token within the sequence, we add a **positional encoding** to the input embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use trigonometric functions of different frequencies:\n",
    "  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \\sin\\left(\\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The positional encoding is added to the token embeddings, allowing the model to learn positional information and generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Positions that are closer together produce similar positional encodings.\n",
    "- The model can learn to attend based on relative positions due to the sinusoidal pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Feedforward Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Each position in the sequence is then processed by a two-layer fully connected feedforward network (often with a ReLU or GELU non-linearity) applied identically to each position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{FFN}(x) = \\max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expands the dimensionality in the intermediate representation, increasing the representational capacity.\n",
    "- Applied pointwise to each token’s representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adds more depth and non-linearity to the model.\n",
    "- Helps the model capture more complex transformations of the input representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Example Implementation in PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simplified example of a few core Transformer components: Multi-Head Attention, Positional Encoding, and a feedforward layer. This is not a full Transformer implementation, but it highlights the core building blocks.\n",
