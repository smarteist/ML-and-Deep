    "## 1. Advantages of Transformers Over RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Parallelization\n",
    "\n",
    "**RNNs:**  \n",
    "- Process tokens sequentially.  \n",
    "- To read the nth token, you must have processed all previous n-1 tokens.\n",
    "- This sequential dependency makes it **difficult to parallelize** computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformers:**  \n",
    "- Compute attention over all tokens **in parallel**.  \n",
    "- No recurrence means the entire sequence can be processed at once.\n",
    "- Training can leverage hardware acceleration (e.g., GPUs) effectively, speeding up large-scale training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Illustration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**RNN Processing:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Time step:   t=1    t=2    t=3    ...\n",
    "Input seq:   w1 --->w2 --->w3 ---> ...\n",
    "             ^      |\n",
    "             |      waits for output at t=1\n",
    "             waits for output at t=1 & t=2\n",
    "```\n",
    "You must wait for previous steps to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformer Processing:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input seq: w1, w2, w3, ...\n",
    "All processed simultaneously through attention:\n",
    "   |   |   |\n",
    "   v   v   v\n",
    "Attention computations (parallel)\n",
    "   |   |   |\n",
    "Output representations (parallel)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Handling Long-Range Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**RNNs:**  \n",
    "- Long sequences cause vanishing gradients and make it hard for RNNs to maintain information over long distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformers:**  \n",
    "- Self-attention directly connects every token to every other token with a single operation.\n",
    "- The attention mechanism can focus on distant parts of the sequence easily, improving model performance on tasks requiring long-range context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Illustration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In an RNN, to connect the first and last token in a long sequence, information must pass through all intermediate states:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "w1 -> h1 -> h2 -> h3 -> ... -> hN-1 -> wN\n",
    "Gradients and information degrade over many steps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Transformer, attention links every token pair directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "w1 <------------------> wN\n",
    " ^                       ^\n",
    " \\-----------------------/\n",
    "Direct attention paths enable easy long-range interactions\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 2. Variants and Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Transformer design has inspired many variants and improvements. Let's briefly introduce a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Transformer-XL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Idea:**  \n",
    "Transformer-XL introduces a **segment-level recurrence** and **relative positional embeddings**, enabling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Processing of longer sequences than the standard Transformer.\n",
    "- Better handling of context that spans beyond a single input segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit:**\n",
    "- Improves upon the standard Transformer for language modeling tasks, handling longer contexts effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 ALBERT (A Lite BERT)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Idea:**\n",
    "- Reduces the size of the model by sharing parameters across layers.\n",
    "- Factorizes the embedding size to improve parameter efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Much fewer parameters than BERT, with minimal performance loss.\n",
    "- Faster training and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 GPT Series (GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Idea:**\n",
    "- Generative Pre-Training using Transformer decoders.\n",
    "- Train on large amounts of text data to learn general language patterns.\n",
    "- Larger and larger models (GPT-2, GPT-3) show emergent abilities, improved fluency, and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Excellent at generating coherent text.\n",
    "- Few-shot and zero-shot learning capabilities (especially in GPT-3 and GPT-4).\n",
    "\n",
